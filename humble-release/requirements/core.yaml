          Launch using the `rviz2` command.

          The rviz window should be generally usable and should be able to load some of the discovered visualizations.

          Loading visualizations into the tree and using the mouse to navigate through the virtual workspace is sufficient for this test.

          - note: In RViz, in the left pane, click 'Add'. A window will pop up. In that window, under 'rviz_default_plugins', select 'TF' and click 'OK'. Under 'Displays', in the 'Global Options' section, change the 'Fixed Frame' to '/world'.
          - note: In RViz, in the left pane, click 'Add'. A window will pop up. In that window, under 'rviz_default_plugins', select 'LaserScan' and click 'OK'. Under 'Displays', in the 'LaserScan' section, change the 'Topic' to '/scan'.
        expect:
          - note: You should see the dummy robot's kinematic tree waving back and forth in the rviz window.
          - note: You should see a laser scan emitting from the waving end of the dummy robot.
          - note: Play around, move the camera, enable and disable things in the 'Displays' pane. RViz should be stable.

          - note: With 'Plugins > Introspection > Node Graph' you should see a network of the nodes and topics that are being published and subscribed by the dummy robot.
          - note: With 'Plugins > Logging > Bag' you should be able record a ROS Bag file.
          - note: With 'Plugins > Topic > Topic Monitor' you should be able to check the `/joint_states` topic and view messages streaming in.

      Build a package in a local workspace which depends on packages supplied for the platform.

      Run the tests for the package - all of them should pass.

      For source platforms, this means building the candidate package in a separate workspace from the one used in the installation instructions.

      TODO: Create a "dummy" package that ensures that we can target other packages using CMake, link against them, and run executables (tests) that are linked against libraries in the main workspace.
